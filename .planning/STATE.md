# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Backend-first build order — structured output endpoint must be verifiable via curl before any UI work
- Roadmap: Tone unification is independent of review engine and can run in parallel
- Roadmap: Research recommends `format: { schema }` with full JSON Schema for Ollama constrained decoding (not `format: "json"`)
- [Phase 02]: Mode-specific personalities preserved (explain=patient teacher, bugs=protective friend, refactor=helpful coach)
- [Phase 02]: Refactor mode enhanced with 'Here's What to Tell Your AI' section for copy-pasteable prompts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Ollama version at 192.168.50.7:11424 must be 0.5.0+ for JSON Schema `format` support — verify in Phase 1
- zod-to-json-schema Zod v4 compatibility unconfirmed — verify at install time
- Small model (<7B) structured output quality is LOW confidence — needs empirical testing in Phase 4
