# Create PRP (Execution Plan with Multi-Agent Task Breakdown)

**Prerequisites:** The template `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md` must exist in the project (or in the context-engineering template). Ensure this template exists before generating a PRP.

## Input: $ARGUMENTS

**Accept:** A **PRD** path (e.g. `PRDs/my-app.md`) or **INITIAL.md** (or feature description). Prefer PRD when the user has run `/generate-prd`; otherwise use INITIAL.md or chat input.

Generate a complete **execution plan (PRP)** with **multi-agent task breakdown**: small, assignable tasks for accuracy. Ensure context is passed to the AI agent for self-validation and iterative refinement. Read the input file first to understand goals, scope, and requirements.

The AI agent only gets the context you are appending to the PRP and training data. Assume the AI agent has access to the codebase and the same knowledge cutoff as you, so its important that your research findings are included or referenced in the PRP. The Agent has Websearch capabilities, so pass urls to documentation and examples.

## Research Process

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Search for similar features/patterns in the codebase
   - Identify files to reference in PRP
   - Note existing conventions to follow
   - Check test patterns for validation approach

2. **External Research**
   - Search for similar features/patterns online
   - Library documentation (include specific URLs)
   - Implementation examples (GitHub/StackOverflow/blogs)
   - Best practices and common pitfalls

3. **User Clarification** (only if scope or patterns are unclear)
   - Specific patterns to mirror and where to find them?
   - Integration requirements and where to find them?

## PRP Generation

Using PRPs/templates/prp_base.md as template:

### Critical Context to Include and pass to the AI agent as part of the PRP
- **Documentation**: URLs with specific sections
- **Code Examples**: Real snippets from codebase
- **Gotchas**: Library quirks, version issues
- **Patterns**: Existing approaches to follow

### Implementation Blueprint
- Start with pseudocode showing approach
- Reference real files for patterns
- Include error handling strategy

### Multi-agent task breakdown (required)
- Break work into **small, assignable tasks** (1–2 hours each, single-responsibility, testable).
- For each task: scope (what it owns), assignable unit (agent/pass), and acceptance (how to verify).
- Use the "Multi-agent task breakdown" section in [PRPs/templates/prp_base.md](PRPs/templates/prp_base.md).
- List tasks in dependency order so execution (e.g. `/execute-prp`) can run them accurately.

### List of tasks
- List tasks to be completed to fulfill the PRP in the order they should be completed

### Validation Gates (Must be Executable) eg for python
```bash
# Syntax/Style
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Unit Tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

```

*** CRITICAL AFTER YOU ARE DONE RESEARCHING AND EXPLORING THE CODEBASE BEFORE YOU START WRITING THE PRP ***

*** ULTRATHINK ABOUT THE PRP AND PLAN YOUR APPROACH THEN START WRITING THE PRP ***

## Output
Save as: `PRPs/{feature-name}.md`

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All necessary context included
- [ ] Validation gates are executable by AI
- [ ] References existing patterns
- [ ] Clear implementation path
- [ ] Error handling documented

Score the PRP on a scale of 1-10 (confidence level to succeed in one-pass implementation using claude codes)

Remember: The goal is one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context.
